# TO DO

- [x] Import funcitons as ES6 modules into index.js rather than have them all inside.
- [x] Get Stackblitz working on my work laptop so I can develop at work.
- [ ] Instead of hard coding index's into functions, see if I can use a Vlookup type function to only input in the coloumns in the data set. Thus when my dataset has less column/features the code base should work with minial changeing. This will allow it to be used better with constructon data.
