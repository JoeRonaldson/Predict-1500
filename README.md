This is the MVP code for a prediction app that takes in a number of features and outputs a predicted score. I use a machine learning regression model to do this.

# Use Case

The use case for this code is to predict rowing 2,000m ergometer test times based off an athletes training scores, age and weight.

The 2,000m (2k) ergometer (erg) test in rowing is the gold standard in measuring physiological performance in athletes. The test scores are used in the selection process and with experienced rowers can generally be linked with on the water rowing performace (this can be debated).
Like any maximal effort test, few are done throughout the season due to the toll it can take on the body and the interuptions it causes to training. In a typical season an athlete may only do two 2k erg tests. Thus for a coach its can be hard to guage an athletes ability outside of certain times in the season.

The use case for this code solves the problem by using an atheletes score in a particular weekly training session to predict there potential 2k erg score.
